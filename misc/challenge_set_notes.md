# challenge set notes
- demarcating playlist indices by challenges 
- note that I am guessing which ones correspond to the "random tracks"
and which ones for the "real" tracks (I am assuming the challenge gives
"random" tracks that are somewhat related to the "real" tracks, how we
effectively simulate this,.... I have no clue)
